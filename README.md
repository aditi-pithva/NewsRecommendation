# News Recommendation

# MIND News Recommendation System

This project aims to build a **complex news recommendation system** using clickstream interaction data and article metadata from the [Microsoft News Dataset (MIND)](https://msnews.github.io/). The system incorporates **multiple recommendation techniques**, focusing on detailed exploration, modeling logic, and justification of each step.

---

## Dataset Overview

**Files Used:**
- `behaviors.tsv` — User sessions with click/impression logs.
- `news.tsv` — News metadata including categories, titles, abstracts, and named entities.

---

## Project Goals

- Understand and preprocess raw clickstream data
- Engineer user, content, temporal, and semantic features
- Explore multiple recommendation strategies:
  - Content-based
  - Collaborative filtering
  - Hybrid models
  - Deep learning-based ranking (NRMS, DIN, etc.)
- Evaluate model performance with relevance-based metrics
- Justify each decision with **problem → technique → outcome** structure

## Step-by-Step Pipeline

### 1. Data Understanding & Exploration
- Distribution of impressions, history length, CTR
- Session volume over time
- Article title/abstract lengths
- Category and subcategory analysis
- Entity frequency in titles (NER)

### 2. Feature Engineering (Upcoming)
- User and session features (history, time, recency)
- Article embeddings (TF-IDF, BERT, Entity-based)
- Time-based features
- Cold-start handling strategies

### 3. Modeling Approaches
- **Content-based filtering** using text and entities
- **Collaborative filtering** (matrix factorization, KNN)
- **Hybrid models** (LightFM, feature fusion)
- **Deep learning**: NRMS, DIN, attention-based user modeling

### 4. Evaluation
- CTR baseline comparison
- Hit@K, MRR, NDCG
- Diversity and novelty (optional)
- Temporal evaluation (e.g., train on past days, test on future)

## Visualizations

- Click-through patterns
- Session and history distributions
- Entity frequency charts
- Category distributions

- NLP: `sklearn`, `transformers`, `Sentence-BERT`
- Recommender systems: `LightFM`, `implicit`, `tensorflow-recommenders`
- Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
